 {\textbf{The cuckoos} are generally medium-sized slender birds. Most species live in trees, though a sizeable minority are ground-dwelling. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution; the majority of species are tropical. Some species are migratory. The cuckoos feed on \underline{insects, insect larvae} and a variety of other animals, as well as fruit. Some species are \textbf{brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species and giving rise to the metaphor cuckoo's egg}, but the majority of species raise their own young.} \par

 {\emph{Cuckoos have played a role in human culture for thousands of years}, appearing in Greek mythology as sacred to the goddess Hera. In Europe, the cuckoo is associated with spring, and with cuckoldry, for example in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost.\textbf{ In India, cuckoos are sacred to Kamadeva}, the god of desire and longing, whereas in Japan, the cuckoo symbolises \textbf{unrequited} \underline{love}.} \par
